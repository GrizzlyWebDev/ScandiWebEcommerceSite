# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for your time and introduce myself a bit! 

My Name is Phill Blake and I am from NY in USA.

I am eager to learn and grow as a developer and look forward to a future with scandiweb!

I have about 6 months expirience as a blockchain dAPP freelancer and started seriously programming about a year ago.

I learned react 6 months ago and used functional components and hooks.

This is actually my first time using redux and class components.

I've never had anyone review my code.

If you have any questions or would like to reach out my contact info is below.
